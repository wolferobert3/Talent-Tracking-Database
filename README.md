# Talent-Tracking-Database
This program scans PDF resumes using the Java PDFbox library to identify job skills required by a client. Users can create databases (e.g., a database for each open position), deposit resumes into databases, and view either all candidates in the database or just those candidates which meet user-defined search criteria.
